      <h3>5 Simple Health Habits Every Student Should Start Today</h3>
      <p>From hydration to screen time, here are five realistic things every student can do to feel better fast.</p>

      <section>
       <strong>Intro:</strong> Why Students Struggle, and Why Small Changes Matter
Between back-to-back classes, endless assignments, part-time jobs, and social life, students often treat their health like an afterthought. Sleep gets sacrificed. Meals are skipped or replaced with energy drinks. Days go by without a single stretch. The problem isn’t lack of desire—it’s overwhelm. When everything feels urgent, taking care of yourself drops to the bottom of the list. But here’s the truth: small habits make a big difference. You don’t need a complete lifestyle overhaul to feel better. You just need to start.
Here are five simple, low-effort health habits every student can start today—and why they matter.</section>

 <h2>1.<strong> Drink Enough Water</strong></h2>
 <p>Why it matters:</p> Dehydration doesn’t just make you thirsty—it zaps your energy, affects your concentration, and can even mimic the feeling of anxiety. Your body and brain need water to function properly, and most students don’t drink nearly enough of it.
 <p>Quick tip:</p> Start your day with a full glass of water before your coffee or breakfast. Keep a refillable bottle on your desk or in your bag. Aim for around 6–8 cups a day, more if you’re active or it’s hot out. If plain water doesn’t appeal to you, add lemon or cucumber slices to make it more interesting.</section>

 <section>
    <h2>2.<strong>Get 7–8 Hours of Sleep</strong></h2>
  <p>Why it matters:</p> Sleep isn’t a luxury—it’s fuel. When you don’t get enough, your brain slows down. Your focus drops. Your memory takes a hit. And your mood? It’s more fragile than you think. Pulling an all-nighter might seem like a productivity win, but it often backfires.
  <p>Quick tip:</p> Create a basic bedtime routine. Shut down screens 30 minutes before bed. Use a sleep app or even just a consistent alarm to help set a rhythm. Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends.</section>

  <section>
    <h2>3.<strong> Take Short Walks or Stretch Daily</strong></h2>
   <p>Why it matters:</p> Sitting all day wrecks your posture, messes with your circulation, and leaves you feeling sluggish. You don’t need to hit the gym for an hour. Just moving a little each day can reset your energy, reduce stress, and help clear your mind.
   <p>Quick tip:</p> Set a timer every hour or two to stand, stretch, or walk around for 5 minutes. Take calls while walking. Stretch before bed. Even a ten-minute stroll between classes can boost your focus and improve your mood.
</section>
 

   <section>
    <h2> 4. <strong>Reduce Screen Time at Night</strong></h2>
    <p>Why it matters:</p> Late-night scrolling throws off your body’s natural sleep-wake cycle. The blue light from phones and laptops tricks your brain into thinking it’s still daytime, making it harder to fall—and stay—asleep. It also fuels anxiety and overstimulation.
     <p>Quick tip: </p>Set a screen curfew—say, no phones after 10 p.m. Use Night Shift or blue light filters on your devices if you absolutely must be on them. Consider keeping your phone out of reach when you're winding down.</section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.<strong>Eat One Nutritious Meal Per Day</strong></h2>
   <p>Why it matters:</p> You don’t need to eat like a nutritionist every day, but getting at least one solid, balanced meal gives your body something to work with. It helps regulate your blood sugar, keep your brain sharp, and reduce crashes throughout the day.
   <p>Quick tip:</p>Start with breakfast or lunch. Add protein (eggs, tofu, chicken, beans), some healthy fats (avocado, nuts), and veggies. If you’re ordering out, go for a grain bowl or a wrap with fresh ingredients instead of fast food. Planning even one nutritious meal takes the pressure off the rest of the day.</section>5. 

 <h2>Conclusion:</h2> Start Small, Stick with It
No student has perfect health habits—and no one needs to. But starting small builds momentum. These habits don’t require extra money, equipment, or dramatic lifestyle changes. Just a bit of intention. Choose one to start today, and once it sticks, add another.
As someone deeply interested in medicine, I’ve seen how even minor habits can transform a person’s energy, focus, and mental health. You don’t have to wait until you crash to take care of yourself. Start with water, sleep, a stretch, a screen break, or a real meal. Your future self will thank you.
